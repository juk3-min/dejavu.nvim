# üîÅ dejavu

**dejavu** is a plugin to improve the repeat pattern in nvim.  
The [native dot command](https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html) supports a variety of repetitions, but some are missing, making certain commands awkward to repeat.
dejavu fills this gap.


Other plugins allow registering commands to make them repeatable:

- https://github.com/jonatan-branting/nvim-better-n  
- https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat/tree/master

Both need setup for commands to make them repeatable.  
dejavu follows a different approach:  
The last normal mode command is simply made available via a macro register or custom callback.

---

## ‚ú® Features 

Repeat the following things by creating a macro for it:

- `hjkl` commands with a count  
- `f`/`F` search  
- `t`/`T` search  
- Bracket Commands such as `[d`, `]d`, `[q`, `]q`  
- Plugin commands, triggered through normal mode  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works?

All normal mode input is tracked and chunked into commands.  
This is done through autocommands which add a keylogger (`vim.fn.on_key()`) while in normal and operator-pending mode.  
When a SafeState is reached, the end of the command is detected, and the callback with this command is triggered.  
The keylogger is automatically disabled in other modes.

By default, it puts the command into the `"x"` register. To repeat the command call `@x`.

The following commands are intentionally **excluded from storage:
**

- Commands which only use a single keystroke  
- Commands starting with `<CR>` / Enter  
- Commands which call the `macro_key`, therefore triggering a recursive infinite loop

### üí• which-key

[which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim/tree/main) is an awesome plugin to help you remember all your keybinds.  
which-key seems to intercept keystrokes, and sends them again when a full command is reached.  
This leads to a duplication in the macro ‚Äî e.g. `4j` will be registered as `4j4j`.

dejavu handles this by detecting duplication and retaining only the intended portion of the command.

During normal macro recording this would not be an issue since which-key turns off while recording a macro in the usual way.  
However, some commands cannot be corrected ‚Äî e.g., surrounding a word with a bracket `saiw'` becomes `saiiw'` with which-key turned on.  
Fixing this is not trivial, and thus not implemented.

> [!NOTE]  
> Many surround plugins feature dot repeats already.

## üì¶ Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager.

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
    'juk3-min/dejavu.nvim',
    opts = {},
}
```

---
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The following options can be passed via `optsq or set in an explicit setup() call...if other
plugins are required (e.g. [fidget](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim) for notifications)
```lua
{
    enabled = false,             -- Should the plugin be enabled from the start
    macro_key = 'x',             -- macro_key which is set with the previous command. If a callback is defined, the callback is prioritized
    callback = function(command) -- Callback which is triggered when a command is detected
      vim.fn.setreg('x', command)
    end,
    notify = vim.notify,         -- function to notify with
    which_key = false,           -- Is which-key installed? If false dejavu also checks by itself
}
```

---
### Examples
Using config in this case is necessary to use fidget for notifications.
```lua
  {
    'juk3-min/dejavu.nvim',
    dependencies = { 'j-hui/fidget.nvim' },
    config = function()
      require('dejavu').setup {
        notify = require('fidget').notification.notify,
      }
    end,
  },
```

To turn of notifications use
```lua
        notify = function(_) end,  
```

or a simple setup to simply print the last command and enable the plugin from the start
```lua
 {
    'juk3-min/dejavu.nvim',
    opts = {
      callback = function(x)
        vim.print(x)
      end,
      enabled = true,
    },
```
